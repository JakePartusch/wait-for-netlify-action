# Wait for Netlify GitHub Action ðŸŽ‰

Do you have other Github actions (Lighthouse, Cypress, etc) that depend on the Netlify Preview URL? This action will wait until the url is available before running the next task.

## Inputs

### `site_name`

**Required** The name of the Netlify site to reach `https://{site_name}.netlify.com`

### `max_timeout`

Optional â€” The amount of time to spend waiting on Netlify. Defaults to `60` seconds

## Example usage

```
steps:
  - name: Waiting for 200 from the Netlify Preview
    uses: actions/wait-for-netlify-action@v1
    id: waitFor200
    with:
      site_name: "jakepartusch"
      max_timeout: 60
```
